2007 
A girl group debuted who would change the South Korean
music industry forever.

The second generation's female pioneers in Korean pop music.
Paving a path, countless girl groups after them would follow.

Ten years later
SNSD and SONE have made music, danced, acted, benefits & happiness for a decade.
Together we are legendary, and our tenth anniversary will be no less special.
